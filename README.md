- Hi, I’m @ZetaEtaTheta
- I’m interested in economics, philosophy, psychology, religious history; mainly early christianity, theology and video games.
- I’m currently learning nothing, but I need to start learning programming stuff.
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I can barely program, I'm just using this to down/upload dotfiles and stuff.
- How to reach me? Message me here.
